        Galavance is an Atlanta Club, Bar, and Event DJ. Spinning a wide range
        of EDM, Trap, Rap, Hip-hop, Top 40, and Throwbacks that keep the dance
        floor moving. Past gigs in New York City and Philly. Being a DJ is my
        passion. I'll take your audience on a journey they'll never forget,
        whether it's a wedding club or private event! I play what connects with
        my client and their guests. Then I drive the vibe and energy of the
        event depending on what you want. Rowdy party with a NYC DJ? I can do
        that. Deeper electronic music cuts throughout the night that intrigue,
        surprise and make people dance all night? I'm your man. Chill networking
        or professional event with music that matches? I'll play just the right
        music to help the crowd get past the initial inertia. I ensure I arrive
        at any event with ample time before it begins so everything is ready to
        sound great once the event kicks off. Above all else I put in the work
        to make sure your guest and you have a great time at the event.
